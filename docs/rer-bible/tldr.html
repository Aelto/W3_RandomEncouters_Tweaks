    <h2>TL;DR</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Getting started</h3>

        <p>
            You just installed the mod and wish to know what's new without going
            in too much into the details. This article aims at listing the main
            features of the mod and what you should expect from it, that way you
            get no bad surprises.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>A slow start</h3>

        <p>
            The mod can be a bit much in fresh playthroughs, for this reason
            it starts slower than what the settings allow and increases by 10%
            of its capacity each hour until it reaches 100% after 10 hours of gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're wondering if the mod is working, the best way to confirm it
            is to see if you get the preset selector the first time you load a save
            with the mod, or to use the <span>rerbounty</span> command to start a
            bounty (and eventually <span>rerabandonbounty</span> to finish it).
        </p>

        <p>
            Be patient and wait until you reach Velen before tweaking the settings,
            White-Orchard being a smaller area with flat terrain can make the chances
            of being ambushed much higher than they should be.
        </p>

        <h3>The world</h3>

        <p>
            The mod obviously adds new monsters to your world, but sometimes not
            in the way you expect it to. The mod has the possibility to spawn
            monsters in a large radius around you, but also depending on you what you do.
            (<a href="encounters/index.html">You can read more about the encounters system for enemies that a spawned
                while you're out of combat</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes fighting a pack of wolves doesn't yield the results you wanted,
            instead the noise you made attracked a curious Wyvern that slept nearby.
            (<a href="events/fightnoise.html">See the fight noise event</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Be careful of what you leave behind, don't forget necrophages are attracted
            by the scent of blood. (<a href="events/bloodnecrophages.html">See the the blood necrophages event</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't expect your exploration to go the same way it did in your last playthrough,
            the mini-boss you fought may now have allies or even a sibling with him. (<a
                href="events/fillgroups.html">See the fill group event</a>)
        </p>

        <h3>The contracts</h3>

        <p>
            A feature you may find confusing at first is the reputation system and
            the <a href="./contracts/index.html">contract system</a> RER introduces.
        </p>

        <p>
            These two systems will control what you see on the noticeboards of your
            game, it may add new notices but it may also hide some depending on your settings.
            By default all noticeboards will get an additional notice from A. Letoth,
            a generous person offering sweet rewards for the dangerous monsters heads!
        </p>

        <p>
            If you wish to learn more about the contract system and the reputation
            system, you can head to <a href="./contracts/index.html">the contract system</a> page.

        <h3>The characters</h3>

        <p>
            The mod adds a new NPC in all the regions you visit.
            He is known as the bounty master, and as you may have guessed, he gives
            access to a unique bounty system. But not only that! He offers services
            related to the other features of the mod such as contracts and trophies.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can learn more about him in <a href="./bounties/index.html">the bounty system</a> page.
