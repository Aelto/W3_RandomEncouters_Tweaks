  <section>
      <h3>Getting started</h3>

      <p>
          You just installed the mod and wish to know what's new without going
          in too much into the details. This article aims at listing the main
          features of the mod and what you should expect from it, that way you
          get no bad surprises.

      <h3>The world</h3>

      <p>
          The mod obviously adds new monsters to your world, but sometimes not
          in the way you expect it to. The mod has the possibility to spawn
          monsters in a large radius around you, and depending you what you do.
      </p>

      <p>
          Sometimes fighting a pack of wolves doesn't yield the results you wanted,
          instead the noise you made attracked a curious Wyvern that slept nearby.
          (<a href="events/fightnoise.html">See the fight noise event</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
          Be careful of what you leave behind, don't forget necrophages are attracted
          by the scent of blood. (<a href="events/bloodnecrophages.html">See the the blood necrophages event</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
          Don't expect your exploration to go the same way it did in your last playthrough,
          the mini-boss you fought may now have allies or even a sibling with him. (<a href="events/fillgroups.html">See the fill group event</a>)

      <h3>The contracts</h3>

      <p>
          A feature you may find confusing at first is the reputation system and
          the <a href="./contracts/index.html">contract system</a> RER introduces.
      </p>

      <p>
          These two systems will control what you see on the noticeboards of your
          game, it may add new notices but it may also hide some. The reputation
          system asks you to complete at least two RER contracts before you can see
          the notices from the vanilla contracts. Without completing the two RER
          contracts your will consist only of errands and the RER notice.
      </p>

      <p>
          If you wish to learn more about the contract system and the reputation
          system, you can head to <a href="./contracts/index.html">the contract system</a> page.

          If you wish to remove the requirement of 2 RER contracts, you can edit
          the requirement slider in the contract system menu.

      <h3>The characters</h3>

      <p>
          The mod adds a new Non Playable Character in all the regions you visit.
          He is known as the bounty master, and as you may have guessed, he gives
          access to a unique bounty system. But not only that, he offers other services
          related to other features of the mod.
      </p>

      <p>
          You can learn more about him in <a href="./bounties/index.html">the bounty system</a> page.
