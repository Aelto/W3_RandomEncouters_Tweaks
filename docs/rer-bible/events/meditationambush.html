    <h2>Meditation ambush</h2>

    <p>
      The <span>meditation ambush</span> event simulates how dangerous it would be
      for Geralt to meditate in the wilderness for a long time. Whenever you meditate
      outside a settlement there is a chance you will get attacked. The longer the
      meditation the higher the chance.
      <br>
      This event also works for Friendly Meditation or the EE meditation.
