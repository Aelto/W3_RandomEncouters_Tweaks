    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>
      Events in RER are <i>stuff</i> that happens based on your actions. For example,
      fighting makes noise, and noise attracts curious creatures around you. Or bleeding
      attracts necrophages. Higher chance to get ambushed by swamp creatures when you
      enter a swamp.
      <br>
      But not all events need the player interaction. Some events change the
      world around you without you noticing. The ecosystem for example is controlled
      by an event. Or there is another event that adds creatures to groups of vanilla creatures
      to make your playthroughs different each time.

    <p>
      The event menu has three types of sliders, the first two are the most important ones,
      <img src="eventsystemsliders.png" alt="image showing the two first sliders for events">
      The first one, the interval, is something you should actually not change.
      It controls how often RER checks for new events.
      <br>
      the second one, <span>Seconds before an event can trigger again</span> is what
      I call the <span>ICD</span> (internal cooldown). It is the most important slider.
      The value you set here in the ICD is the base value for all the percentages you
      will set below. For example, if you set 60 seconds in the ICD and 10% in an event,
      it means there is a 10% chance the event will trigger every 60 seconds. But if
      you increase the ICD without changing the percentage, you will indirectly see
      less events. And as the name implies it also prevents event from triggering twice
      in the interval you set.
