    <h2>Remains necrophages</h2>

    <p>
      The <span>remains necrophages</span> event simulates how necrophages are
      attracted to corpses you leave behind you. Whenever you kill a creature and
      it leaves stuff on the ground, there is a chance nearby necrophages will come.
      <br>
      this event only takes the initial remains dropped directly by the creature into account.
      So if you pick up everything off the ground and then drop the unwanted loot back in a clean lootbag,
      necrophages wont be able to sense it.
