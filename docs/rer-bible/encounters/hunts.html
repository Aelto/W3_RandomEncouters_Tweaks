    <h2>Hunts</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="ambushes.png" alt="">
      Hunts, like any encounter have two menus for them. One for the day and one
      for the night. Useful if you want hunts only during the day and none during the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, you can control with the frequency slider how often you see hunts.
      <img src="frequency.png" alt="image showing the frequency slider">
      It is a ratio of all the frequency sliders from all the encounters, so if you set one to
      <span>5</span> and another to <span>50</span> it means the one with <span>50</span>
      has 10 times the chance to appear compared to the one with <span>5</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you can control which creatures you see from hunts.
      <img src="ambushes-settings.png" alt="image showing the hunt settings">
      These are ratios too, you don't have to calculate the exact % but you simply
      need to know that 100 is ten times more than 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from hunts roam the world freely and leave tracks on the ground.
      They don't directly go towards Geralt and simply mind their own business,
      until you get close enough.
