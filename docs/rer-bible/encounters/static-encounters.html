    <h2>Static encounters</h2>

    <p>
      Static encounters are a bit different from the other encounters. They are not
      random and are handplaced by me on areas I think fit. The goal of the static
      encounters is to add respawning creatures to your world so that you can get
      materials and mutagens whenever you want. It is also a nice surprise to enter
      a cave and see a Ekimmara you didn't see in your vanilla playthrough or enter
      go to an abandonned village and see corpses everywhere with bandits around.

    <p>
      Static encounters are split in two categories, the large static encounters
      and the small static encounters. Large ones are those who spawn large creatures
      like a Leshen, a Griffin, a vampire etc... while small ones are small creatures
      like bandits, ghouls, wolves, bears, etc...
      By default static encounters do not have a 100% chance to respawn every time
      you reload your save but instead have 60% or 80% chance to add a bit of surprise
      and randomness to the thing.
