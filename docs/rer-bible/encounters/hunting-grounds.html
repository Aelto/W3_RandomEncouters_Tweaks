    <h2>Hunting grounds</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="ambushes.png" alt="">
      Hunting grounds, like any encounter have two menus for them. One for the day and one
      for the night. Useful if you want hunting grounds only during the day and none during the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, you can control with the frequency slider how often you see hunting grounds.
      <img src="frequency.png" alt="image showing the frequency slider">
      It is a ratio of all the frequency sliders from all the encounters, so if you set one to
      <span>5</span> and another to <span>50</span> it means the one with <span>50</span>
      has 10 times the chance to appear compared to the one with <span>5</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you can control which creatures you see from hunting grounds.
      <img src="ambushes-settings.png" alt="image showing the hunting grounds settings">
      These are ratios too, you don't have to calculate the exact % but you simply
      need to know that 100 is ten times more than 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from hunting grounds stick to one location and try not to move away
      from it, until you get close enough and the whole group attacks you. This encounter
      is intended to look like vanilla groups of creatures that you often see in the world.
