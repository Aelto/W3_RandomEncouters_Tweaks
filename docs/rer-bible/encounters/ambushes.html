    <h2>Ambushes</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="ambushes.png" alt="">
      Ambushes, like any encounter have two menus for them. One for the day and one
      for the night. Useful if you want ambushes only during the night and none during the day
    </p>

    <p>
        First, you can control with the frequency slider how often you see ambushes.
        <img src="frequency.png" alt="image showing the frequency slider">
        It is a ratio of all the frequency sliders from all the encounters, so if you set one to
        <span>5</span> and another to <span>50</span> it means the one with <span>50</span>
        has 10 times the chance to appear compared to the one with <span>5</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you can control which creatures you see from ambushes.
      <img src="ambushes-settings.png" alt="image showing the ambush settings">
      These are ratios too, you don't have to calculate the exact % but you simply
      need to know that 100 is ten times more than 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ambushes are simple. When the encounter is spawned, creatures will always go towards
      Geralt and look for a fight. There is no way to escape them and you have no other
      choice than to kill them.
