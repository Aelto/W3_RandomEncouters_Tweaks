  <h2>Bounties</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>What are they</h3>

    <p>
      Bounties from the mod consist in a series of targets you must kill.
      These targets can be anywhere around the world, but mostly around various
      point of interests. Completing a bounty increases your bounty level, which
      controls the overall difficulty of the bounties but the rewards as well.
    </p>

    <h3>The bounty master</h3>

    <p>
      It all starts with the bounty master, the only way to get a bounty is to
      talk to him. He travels the world and visits all the regions of the game,
      he may also move from time to time. To easily find him, he is always marked
      on your map by a yellow quest giver icon surrounded by a white circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bounty master offers other services too, he buys your RER trophies at a
      price no other merchant can compete with. He also trades token of gratitude
      you may have earned from completing <a href="../contracts/index.html">RER contracts</a> for
      valuable items
    </p>

    <h3>The bounty targets</h3>

    <p>
      Bounties always consist of a main target, and a variable amount of side targets.
      Your main objective is to kill the main target, once killed the bounty is over even
      if side targets are still alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slaying a side targets will increase the rewards you will get from the bounty by 100%,
      but it will also cause your fight against the main target to be more complicated. It is
      up to you to increase the rewards until you can't fight anymore.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Bounty levels</h3>

    <p>
      Each region (White Orchard, Velen, Skellige, Toussaint, and new maps from other mods) has
      its own bounty level.

      Whenever you gain a bounty level, you are given a reward. Every few levels result in a
      rarer, more valuable reward. Some of them are unique items you can only obtain from
      completing quests.
