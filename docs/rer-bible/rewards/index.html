    <h2>Rewards</h2>

    <p>
      What would be the point of killing monsters, if you did not get any reward
      for it. RER adds new trophies with the sole purpose of being sold so that
      you can earn a few crowns from the monsters you killed. Because trophies
      may not sell much with the economy altering mods you use, it also includes
      an option for direct crown drops from creatures if you need it.

    </p>

    <p>
      <h3 id="crowns"><a class="paragraph-link" href="#crowns">ยง</a>Crowns</h3>
      In the crown settings, you control the base values for each encounter type.
      <img src="crownbasevalues.png" alt="">
      And then for each creature you control how much of the base value they drop in %.
      This value has some randomness you cannot edit, it varies by between 80% and 120%
      of what you set. So if you set 50% to the Sirens it will in reality vary
      between 40% and 60%
      <img src="crownpercent.png" alt="">
      This allows you to tell RER that Sirens should drop few crowns and also control
      the amount of crowns you get based on the encounter type. Some people do not
      want crowns outside of contracts so they set the <span>From ___</span> sliders to 0
      except for the <span>From contracts</span> slider.
      <br>
      Then you can tweak the amount dropped on a per creature basis.

      <h3 id="trophies"><a class="paragraph-link" href="#trophies">ยง</a>Trophies</h3>
      You can control from which encounters you get RER trophies with the first toggles.
      Creatures from an encounter with the trophies disabled won't drop trophies.
      <img src="trophiesfrom.png" alt="">

      You can also change the price of the trophies you get, but note it is not
      retroactive and won't change the price of the trophies you already picked.
      <img src="trophiesprice.png" alt="">
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, you can edit the chance for the creature to drop trophies.
      <span>100</span> means it has 100% chance to drop a trophy, <span>50</span> 
      means 50% and <span>0</span> means no trophies drop this creature.

      <h3 id="containers-refill"><a class="paragraph-link" href="#contaiers-refill">ยง</a>Containers refill</h3>
      RER has always been about revitalizing old content, or places. This feature
      will refill the containers of regions where you kill monsters. It's a pretty simple
      feature: you kill monsters, containers around you are filled with new loot.

      <blockquote>
        Containers are: boxes, bags, chests, barrels, ...
      </blockquote>

      Obvsiously we all have a different view of balance, this is why this feature
      comes with a <i>few</i> (a lot of) sliders.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="containerrefillpresets.png" alt="image showing the Default preset and the OFF preset">
      But first, let's talk about the presets: the <span>defaults</span> preset
      is applied automatically the first time you play with the mod; and second:
      the <span>OFF</span> preset to disable the feature.
      <br>
      <img src="containermainsliders.png" alt="">
      Now the main sliders:
      <ul>
        <li><span>chance to trigger</span> allows you to define the chance for
          it to happen every time you kill an encounter from RER. Note that it only works
          for RER encounters.
        </li>
        <li><span>Only empty containers</span> by default the feature only works
          on containers that are empty to prevent filling the containers with tons
          of stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Radius</span>, it controls how far around the player RER will
          look for containers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Number of containers</span> tells the maximum number of containers that will
          be refilled when this system triggers. It is not guaranteed to
          reach this number if there are not enough containers around you.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="containerloottablessliders.png" alt="Image showing the sliders for the loot tables">
      Each slider that starts with the little yellow dash is a loot table. Every
      time this system triggers it will randomly pick one loot table for each
      container (if you allowed more than one container per trigger) and then
      fill the container with the objects from the loot table.
      <br>
      The values you set to these sliders control the chance for the loot table
      to be picked. The value is like a ratio/coefficient, <span>15</span> doesn't
      mean this loot table will have 15% chance to be picked. Instead it means
      that it has half the chance to be picked compared to a <span>30</span>.

  <section id="killing-spree-loot">
    <h3><a class="paragraph-link" href="#killing-spree-loot">ยง</a>Killing spree loot</h3>

    <p>
      <img src="custom-loot.png" alt="">
      This feature allows you to unlock new loot tables for the creatures spawned by RER as you
      repeatedly kill monsters in the same areas.
      It is tightly coupled to the ecosystem feature as it uses
      the <a href="../encounters/index.html#state-of-the-ecosystem">ecosystem strength</a> to
      determine what loot table is unlocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="custom-loot-tables-menu.png" alt="">
      The more you kill creatures in an area the more you affect the ecosystem strength,
      then as the ecosystem strength percentage increases (or decreases if you use custom values)
      you will progressively unlock new loot tables.
      <br>
      Each loot table in the menu has two sliders:
      <ul>
        <li>The unlock %</li>
        <li>The drop rate %</li>
      </ul>
      The unlock % tells you at which point you will start seeing loot from this table.
      If your ecosystem strength is at <span>150%</span>, you will unlock any loot table
      with an unlock % at 50 or lower.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second slider controls the drop rate of that loot table once it is unlocked.
      The drop rate continues to increase as you keep killing monsters, even after the
      table is unlocked. this gives you a reason to kill creature and increase the ecosystem
      strength even after you reached your goal. That way you keep increasing the drop rate of all the unlocked tables.
