    <h2>Optional features</h2>

    <p>
      RER has lots of optional features you may want to enable/disable. Here is a
      list of the toggles and what they do

      <ul>
        <li><span>Enable encounters loot</span> when set to OFF completely removes any loot from RER, creature
        materials included</li>
        <li><span>Enable Geralt comments</span> when set to ON, Geralt will play a voiceline whenever an encounter
        is created. Trail's fresh for hunts and he'll slur upon being Ambushed</li>
        <li><span>Enable action camera scenes</span> when you get ambushed a camera scene will play
        showing you the creatures who are about to ambush you. Setting it to OFF will remove this camera scene</li>
        <li><span>Only known bestiary creatures</span> when set to ON, RER won't spawn any creature that
        isn't in your bestiary yet. Therby guaranteeing you a playthrough without any spoilers.</li>
        <li><span>Hide RER notifications</span> when set to OFF will remove some unimportant notifications
        that RER may create</li>
        <li><span>Disable camera scenes</span> when set to OFF will disable all camera scenes created by RER</li>
        <li><span>Disable camera blending</span> when set to OFF will remove the smooth transition when a camera
        scene starts and ends. The transition between the scene camera and the default Geralt camera.</li>
        <li><span>No camera scene on horse</span> is a compatibility option with Immersive Camera.
        IC has a bug in its camera code that makes the game crash during blended transitions, but only
        in horse and combat states.
        </li>
        <li><span>Delay RER loading start (Bootstrap Hooked compatibility)</span> is a compatibility option for
          the Bootstrap Hooked users. This version of bootstrap loads RER so early the bounty master is not
          loaded properly and it causes a crash and him whispering in your ear every time you load your save.
          The option simply delays RER loading by a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li><span>Trophy pickup animation chance</span> controls how often you see the scene that is played
        whenever you get out of combat and there are RER trophies around you.</li>
        <li><span>Use path finding for trails</span> when set to ON, will enable path finding when drawing trails.
          It means that trails will avoid some obstacles and will try to go in a realistic path.
        </li>
        <li><span>Markers toggles</span> control if you want map marker in the different situations.</li>
        <li><span>Skip bounty seed selector window</span> when set to ON will skip the <a href="https://youtu.be/BxBP95s-p5w?t=85">seed selection window</a>
        and use the <a href="../bounties/index.html">seed 0</a> instead</li>
        <li><span>Shorten bounty master conversation</span> when set to ON will skip a good portion of the <a href="../bounties/index.html">bounty master conversation</a></li>
        <li><span>Dynamic creatures size</span> when set to ON allows RER to dynamically change the size of the spawned creatures based on their level. Higher level creatures are bigger and lower level ones are smaller.</li>
      </ul>
