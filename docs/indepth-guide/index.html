      Please keep in mind we're in the process of updating the documentation for
      the next-gen version. While everything is rewritten, documentation for the
      older versions isn't archived yet. If you are using the 1.32 and wish to
      install RER then it is recommended to wait a few days until the old documents
      are published again.

      <h3>Downloading the mod and its dependencies</h3>

        You can use this <a

          direct link

        Alternatively the mod is currently hosted on GitHub, and its releases are shared under
        <a href="https://github.com/Aelto/tw3-random-encounters-reworked/releases">the releases tab</a>.
        You can find the zip archive with the mod and all of its dependencies under

      <h3>Installing the mod and its dependencies</h3>
      <div>
        Navigate in the release archive until you find three folders: bin, dlc, mods;
        drop the folders in your game's root directory to merge them with the existing
        folders. When/if prompted to replace files, deny all requests to ensure
        you do not override any of your existing mods.

        the two given mods.

      <div>
        Once you know which side is FHUD and which side is sharedutils, using the

        pick the sharedutils one and in second the FHUD one.

      <h3>Keybind - Trigger an encounter</h3>

      <div>
        <h4>What is its role?</h4>
        <div>
          When you press the key an encounter will be created by RER after a 5 seconds delay.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>How to add it?</h4>

        <div>
          When you change the settings you usually have to load a save for them to be applied. This keybind solves this
          by forcing a settings refresh without the need to load a save.
