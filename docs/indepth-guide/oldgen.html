      <h3>Dependency - Shared Imports</h3>

      <div>
        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <div>
         It brings a good amount of helper functions RER uses to function.
         But unlike the sharedutils that you'll see bundled with the mod this
         one is not maintained by me and it is not always needed although rarely.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>When should you skip it?</h4>
        <div>
          If you've installed it already or if you have Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition. To check if you've installed it
          already go into <span>The Witcher 3/mods/</span> and look for a folder named <span>modSharedImports</span>
          If you find one skip this dependency.

      <h3>Dependency - CommunityPatch - Base</h3>

      <div>
        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <div>
          This CommunityPatch can be installed to bring all of the variants the 1.32 version of the game has to a common
          state that RER can rely on in order to work reliably. Without it and if you are not of 1.32 Steam GOTY then your
          game may not be able to start without a compile error. Installing the patch is a safe way to bring the 1.32 Steam GOTY
          changes to your game (for example GOG 1.32)
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>When should you skip it?</h4>
        <div>
          If you've installed it already, or if you have Unification Patch, or if you have GM or W3EE installed then you may skip that step. To
          check if you've installed CP-Base already go into <span>The Witcher 3/mods/</span> and look for a folder named
          <span>mod0000___CompilationTrigger</span> if you find one skip this dependency.

        The following mods are shared dependencies. RER uses them but other could

        <h3>Community Patch - Base</h3>

        <div>
          This patch is often needed by big overhauls like Ghost Mode.

          </li>
        </ul>

        Then head to the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3652?tab=files">Community Patch - Base</a>'s
        files
        tab, in the optional section get the vanilla scripts that correspond to your version. Refer to the
